=begin

Consider the following program.

class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
end

pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch
Update this code so that when you run it, you see the following output:

My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.

=end

class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
  attr_reader :name, :age, :colors
  
  def initialize(name, age, colors)
    super(name, age)
    @colors = colors
  end
  
  def to_s
    "My cat #{name} is #{age} years old and has #{colors} fur."
  end
end

pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch

=begin

Further Exploration

An alternative approach to this problem would be to modify the Pet class to accept a colors parameter. If we did this, we wouldn't need to supply an initialize method for Cat.

Why would we be able to omit the initialize method? Would it be a good idea to modify Pet in this way? Why or why not? How might you deal with some of the problems, if any, that might arise from modifying Pet?
